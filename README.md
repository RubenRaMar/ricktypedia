# Rick and Morty Project

## üíª Technology Stack

The project has been developed using a variety of technologies and tools, including:

- **React**: Used for creating the user interface, reusable components, and component state management, among other things.

- **Redux Toolkit**: Employed for managing the global state of the application, ensuring a consistent data flow.

- **Axios**: Utilized for making efficient connections to the Rick and Morty API, allowing for effective data retrieval and updates.

- **Styled-Components**: Used for applying styles and design to the application, creating an attractive and user-friendly experience.

- **Vitest and React Testing Library**: Employed for conducting high-quality tests, ensuring that the application functions optimally and without issues.

- **Husky**: Implemented for quality control at various development stages, including commits, pushes, branch creation, and more.

- **react-router-dom**: Utilized for managing routes and navigation in the application.

- **MSW (Mock Service Worker)**: Used to simulate and test API requests, enabling more precise and repeatable testing.

- **ESLint**: Employed to maintain clean code and adhere to best programming practices.

- **JavaScript and TypeScript**: The application has been developed using both JavaScript and TypeScript from the start, ensuring strong typing and code quality.

This technology stack has allowed for the development of a robust and efficient application that meets the requirements and expectations of the hackathon.

## ‚úÖ Fulfillment of Requirements

The project fulfills the technical and functional requirements, offering a complete and engaging user experience:

- **Real-Time Search List Component**: A real-time search list component has been developed, enabling dynamic and effective search experiences for users.

- **"Show More" Button**: A "Show More" button has been implemented, allowing users to load more results as they scroll, ensuring a smooth and continuous browsing experience.

- **Efficient Routing**: An efficient routing system has been created, allowing users to navigate different sections of the application intuitively, including a details page for each character.

- **API Connection with Axios**: The application successfully connects to the Rick and Morty API to fetch up-to-date and accurate data.

- **React and Redux Toolkit**: React is used for building the user interface and managing local state, while Redux Toolkit efficiently manages global state in a scalable manner.

- **Quality Testing**: A comprehensive set of quality tests has been performed to ensure the correct operation of the application, data integrity, and user satisfaction.

- **SOLID Methodology and Custom Hooks**: The code has been designed following SOLID programming principles, and custom hooks have been created to modularize and reuse application logic effectively.

- **Organization and Optimization**: The project maintains a clear and efficient folder structure, and modern image formats have been used to improve performance and enhance the user experience.

- **Disable Motion Option**: The "prefers-reduced-motion" feature has been implemented to allow users to disable motion in the application, enhancing accessibility and personalization.

- **Planned Future Implementations**: There are plans for future implementations, including the creation of list components for episodes and other features related to locations (planets).

The project has been developed following best practices and is prepared to grow and evolve in future iterations.
